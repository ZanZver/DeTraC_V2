\subsection{Review of Literature and its theory}
In this section, we are going to go across the themes and technologies that are the backbone of our project. Bellow, we have listed all of them and tags, so it is easier to know what each article is discussing. Do note that first 3 technologies (VGG16, ResNet and ResNext) cover bigger scope, therefore titles covering them are organised together.
Technologies and its tags:
\begin{itemize}
  \item VGG16 [VGG16],
  \item ResNet [ResNet],
  \item ResNext [ResNext],
  \item Transfer learning [TL],
  \item Neural networks [NN],
  \item Convolutional neural networks [CNN],
  \item Deep learning [DL],
  \item Clustering [CL].
\end{itemize}
