\subsection{Summary}
This section describes the themes, technologies, and articles applicable based on the project. Section 2.2 if mainly focusing on the use of literature based on the article information while in the section 2.2.4 information regarding development over time can be found.
\newline
Based on the section 2.2, we have found out that different technologies have different approaches and capabilities. The algorithm of choice that seems the most convincing so far is ResNet due to its efficiency and ResNext being the second candidate that needs to be tested on our application if it makes sense.
