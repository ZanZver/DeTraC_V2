First of all, a big thank you to Birmingham City University. They have accepted me to the university, showed me the passion of Data Science and inspired me to continue with further education. BCU was also able to help with providing the server that helped with additional computing power. I have met and learned from many knowledgeable lecturers that I am really thankful for. In particular Dr. Mohammed Abdelsamea and Emmett Cooper who inspired me the most to grow in my final year.

Special thanks goes to the project supervisor Dr. Mohammed Abdelsamea. Throughout the project, Dr. Mohammed was supportive and understanding on the roadblocks that occurred. For me, Dr. Mohammed was a perfect supervisor for this project and a great personal tutor in my final year.
