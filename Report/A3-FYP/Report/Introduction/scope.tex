\subsection{Scope}
Scope of this project is to add functionality to the existing model of DeTraC. Since results needed to be evaluated, it needs to be tested against original model (using composed dataset) vs using new model (using initial dataset). That is giving us equal ground for comparison and an opportunity to compare it to the original paper.
