\subsection{Project Aim and Objectives}
Goal of the project is to modify DeTraC existing code to be capable of training itself on the original dataset since at the moment training is done on the composed dataset.
To achieve this goal, main objectives must be meet along the way. Those are:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Rewriting the code of DeTraC
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In order to achieve the main goal, old code needs to be rewritten and more modular. There are also some functional bugs in the code that are going to be removed with accomplishing this task.
      \item When code is rewritten, implementation of the goal can be achieved.
    \end{itemize}
 \item Reuse and improvement of technology
    \begin{itemize}
      \item DeTraC has already been implemented with some of the technologies in the old code (such as transfer learning, clustering, etc...). Some of the technologies that are in use can be improved. For example, in the old code VGG16 is used as neural network, but in the new code it will be replaced with ResNet16.
      \item Second item is comparison. It can be done between using composed dataset vs original dataset on the newly written code.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
