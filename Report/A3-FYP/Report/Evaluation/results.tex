\subsection{Results}
In this section, we are going to compare results that are used in composed version to the initial version. Number of test cases were executed in order to compare one version against the other. Do note that all of the test cases were executed in "deep tuning" mode for better accuracy. When test was stared, it was an in automatic mode, that meaning both composed dataset and initial dataset scenarios were tested at once.
\newline
Main test cases represented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Test case 1
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Using same parameters as original paper to see how close the program is.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Test case 2
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Parameters are slightly tuned for representing baseline systems.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Test case 3
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Experimenting with smaller dataset.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item Test case 4
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Using same dataset as Test case 3 but adding data augmentation to it.
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
