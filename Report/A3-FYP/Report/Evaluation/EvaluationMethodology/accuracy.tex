\subsubsection{Accuracy}
Accuracy is a calculation that provides results of model overall. It is calculated by meaning the fraction of the total items that were marked correctly by classifier \parencite{web:ConfusionMatrixMulticlassfification}.

\[\frac{True Positives + True Negatives}{True Positives + True Negatives + False Positives + False Negatives} = Accuracy \]
