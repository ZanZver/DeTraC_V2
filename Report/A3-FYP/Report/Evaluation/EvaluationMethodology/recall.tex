\subsubsection{Recall}
This is a ratio between True Positive divided from sum of True Positives and False Negatives. In the equation bellow \parencite{davis2006relationship} we can see mathematical formula for it.
\[\frac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Negatives} = Recall \]

To calculate recall, SkLearn provides another module with the name of recall{\_}score \parencite{web:RecallScore}. We pass y{\_}true and y{\_}pred are passed into the function and recall is returned. Average can be selected same as above in precision.
