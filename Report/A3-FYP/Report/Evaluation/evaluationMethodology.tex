\subsection{Evaluation Methodology}
The mostly used testing strategies in the industry are accuracy and precision. Testing with this is valid, but inclusion of F1 score or Recall is also a solid approach since all of the techniques are used in the industry \parencite{web:testingDL}.
Based on that, five different types of tests are being implemented:
\begin{itemize}
  \item confusion matrix,
  \item accuracy,
  \item precision,
  \item recall,
  \item f1 score.
\end{itemize}
