\section{Introduction} %1
This paper is research based and it is focusing on an area of data science - neural networks. This report is going to walk you across what the project is (1), literature that correlated or inspired the project (2), how the project was created (3) and how the results were tested and evaluated (4).

Before we can get deeper into the paper, lets discuss what DeTraC actually is. It stands for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Decomposition
  \item Transfer learning
  \item Composition
\end{itemize}
It was developed by Dr. A. Abbas, Dr. M. Abdelsamea (who is also project supervisor) and Dr. M. Gaber. Project is being researched as part of BCU \parencite{DeTraCPapaer}.
What DeTraC does well is learning at subclass level. This allows it for faster convergence. Deeper discussion on DeTraC can be found on original paper as well as with the original code \parencite{web:DeTraCOriginalCode} that is being the groundwork for this project.
