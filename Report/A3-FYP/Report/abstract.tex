\section*{Abstract}
DeTraC is a neural network model that stands for key technologies it uses (decomposition, transfer learning and composition) and is researched as part of BCU. 
\newline
This project is research based and it focuses on modification of the original model to determine if initial dataset can be used instead of the composed one and if so, what are the results occurring from it.
\newline
In order to get results, project was recreated with Python and medical data was used for producing the results. 
\newline
Desired outcome was initially a question if we can use initial dataset or not instead of composed data. As project was developed, it turned out that the answer is yes, using initial dataset instead of composed dataset in DeTraC model is possible. Now, the question that we had to answer is: should we use the initial data? 
\newline
At first, tests needed to be reproduced from original paper with new code. This showed some baseline where we are at. After that, parameters were modified to fit initial dataset or composed dataset the most. At the end, it turns out that regardless of parameter turning, usage of initial dataset is not as good as using original composed dataset.
