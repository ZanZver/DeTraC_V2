\section{Recommendations for future work} %6
One of the things that could be added in in the future is testing of ResNext. As mentioned in literature review, ResNext is deeper and "newer" version of ResNet. For this project, testing was tried but it has failed and results of ResNext could not be added. Based on the technology ResNet is build on, assumption can be made that there should be no significant difference (as with VGG16 compared to ResNet18). But those are only assumptions and if there is difference, it would be interesting if it can be proven right or wrong.

Another recommendation that can be made is to use MLOPS concepts. If the project would start with MLOPS concepts in mind, we could track the progress easier and see where we have gotten and how we gotten there.
