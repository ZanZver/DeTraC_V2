\subsection{Appendix C: CI/CD}
CI/CD stands for continues integration / continues development and is part of devops (development operations) tools. The goal of CI/CD is to create a workflow where code of the developer is tested automatically on the push to the Git branch.
\newline
Example of CI/CD would be that we have two developers working on a project. Developer 1 is responsible for frontend development and developer 2 is responsible for backend development. To see if the code is compatible, they (or devops team) can spend a day setting up CI/CD so upon git submission automatic test is done letting them know how compatible frontend is with the backend. This results in financial and time savings since at the end of the project, they know if the code is compatible or not rather to be surprised to see code not working and spend more developer time redoing code \parencite{poth2018deliver}.
