\subsection{Appendix D: MLOPS}
MLOPS stands for machine learning operations and is part of typical ML pipeline. It originates from devops and the goals it tries to solve are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item faster experimentation and model development,
  \item faster deployment of the models,
  \item to see if quality of the model is up to the standard.
\end{itemize}

With the help of MLOPS, ML engineers and data scientists work together for faster development. MLOPS also provides versioning to see how model performed with different parameters \parencite{alla2021mlops}.
