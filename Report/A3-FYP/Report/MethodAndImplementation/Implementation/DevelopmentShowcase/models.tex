\paragraph{Models}
Once we have created a model that we are happy with, we can reuse it. Each model is saved locally under the folder Models. In there we have tensorflow and pythorch models from our previous runs. With this, we can replicate the results and reuse it in other scenarios.
\newline
Models are saved in the correct folder with the prefix of DeTraC, what model is (for example: feature{\_}composer) and when it was generated. Example can be seen under the tree structure bellow.
