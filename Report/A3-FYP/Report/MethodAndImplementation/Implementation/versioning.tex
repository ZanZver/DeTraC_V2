\subsubsection{Versioning}
To maintain different versions of the code, Git (Appendix A: Git) was used for versioning. In more specific terms, GitHub was the chosen platform for hosting code online.

In the projects life cycle, we have moved from DeTraC to DeTraC2. In the original development (that was forked from \parencite{web:DeTraCGitHub}), there were some bugs and unnecessary features (for our use case) implemented. To combat this, new repository was created (DeTraC2) which is hosting the current up to date code. There was a different approach that was taken when new code base was started and that being "add what is needed". To be a bit more specific, one feature was added, tested and improved. So over time, features that were not needed were not added.

In the future, this process could be improved with CI/CD (Appendix C: CI/CD) or MLOPS (Appendix D: MLOPS).
