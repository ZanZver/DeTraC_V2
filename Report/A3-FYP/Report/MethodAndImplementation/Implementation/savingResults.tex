\subsubsection{Saving results}
In the new version of DeTraC code, "Graphs" folder is created for storing graphs and model results inside. After a few executions, it became clear that storing graphs inside one folder can be messy. To overcome the problem, new sub-folder is generated every time model is executed. With this, we get "Model-Run-execution-time" (execution-time is when code was executed) structure. This systems allows us for better organisation and better ability to compare results over time.
