\subsubsection{Execution}
Code execution is kept simple. In the WSL-Ubuntu, we navigate to the correct folder where code is located and then execute with command \verb|python3 Code/main.py|. If there are not any folders in place, that are required, they will be automatically generated. 
\newline
Do note that the folder Data/initial-dataset is the main data source. We need to put the data inside this folder and the data needs to be classed together (ex: folder for dogs, folder for cats).
\newline
If there is a need to change the parameters or algorithm (for example, switch from ResNet18 to ResNet50), user can do that in Code/main.py. There is a set of parameters that can simply be adjusted (such as number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, etc...)
