\section{Conclusions} %5
At the start of the report we asked if modifying original DeTraC code is possible to the extend to use initial dataset instead of the composed dataset. In case if it is, what are performance results?
\newline
Originally, DeTraC was using decomposition$\,\to\,$transfer learning$\,\to\,$composed dataset to achieve high accuracy. To test, if we can replace last step with initial dataset, some modifications were crucial. At the end, it was a success, you can use initial dataset in the last step instead of the composed one, but there is a cost associated with it. It turns out that last step (composed dataset) allows accuracy to be much higher in comparison with initial dataset.
\newline
In regards to the original paper, this proves that researchers developing DeTraC have achieved the goal of high accuracy without using initial dataset.
